# Accordion Bass Tool #

The accordion bass tool is designed to be used as a way to analyze everything about the bass side of the accordion. It is aimed at accordionists wishing to explore the possibilities of chord progressions and bass lines that can be played with the left, and hopefully help them to allow to utilize the bass side better.

The program features a chord picker that allows the user to specify any number of chords, including a number of advanced jazz chords, and will proceed to display all the different ways the chord can be played on the bass side. The tool ranks the button combinations from best to worst and displays all the options in a table. Chords and basses can be stringed together in a sequence, and the tool will display the best options for a series of chords, accounting for the transitions from one chord to the next.

The best options are those that minimize hand movement and finger stretching and allow for most comfortable position. The tool will also suggest possible fingering arrangements in a future version.
